      <p>
        As human society advances, one thing I've noticed is that we keep shrinking the gap between "possible
        someday" and "possible now." We build computers and chips at a pace that would have seemed unrealistic not
        long ago. We develop new medicines, invent new algorithms, and scale technologies faster than previous
        generations could imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
        In computing, I think we're heading into an era where products are increasingly tailored to specific use
        cases, and hardware will follow the same trend. Rather than relying on a small set of general-purpose
        architectures, we'll see more specialized systems built for gaming, large language models, robotics, VR/AR,
        and other domains. In the past, specialization was harder because designing custom hardware and building
        the surrounding software ecosystem took too long and cost too much. So we pushed general platforms further:
        CPUs for a wide range of workloads, GPUs for gaming and then GPGPU for ML and deep learning. But recent
        breakthroughs in tooling, manufacturing, and system design are flipping that equation.
      </p>
      <p>
        A clear example is the inference market. Companies like Cerebras and Groq are building systems designed
        specifically for inference, and in certain settings they can be more power-efficient than general-purpose
        accelerators, even those from NVIDIA. NVIDIA has done outstanding work, and its platforms remain incredibly
        strong because they're generalizable and supported by a mature ecosystem. But as the time and cost required
        to create specialized systems continues to fall, we'll increasingly see high-demand use cases get
        purpose-built hardware and full-stack solutions optimized around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the next big waves will likely come from what people call edge AI, especially robotics. Edge
        deployments have different constraints than data centers: tighter power budgets, lower latency requirements,
        limited cooling, intermittent connectivity, and real-time safety constraints. As it becomes cheaper and
        faster to design new chips and architectures, we'll see more hardware built specifically for these edge and
        robotics needs, along with ecosystems designed around those constraints from day one.
