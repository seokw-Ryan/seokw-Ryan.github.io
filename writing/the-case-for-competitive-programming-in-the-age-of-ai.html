    <h1>The Case for Competitive Programming in the Age of AI</h1>
    <div class="post-date">February 3, 2026</div>
    <article class="post-box">
      <p>
        Some of my friends recently asked me why I'm practicing competitive programming and preparing for ICPC in 2026.
        It's a fair question—one I asked myself just a few months ago before I decided to commit seriously and build my
        skills from the ground up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me be honest: I was never particularly strong at competitive programming or data structures and algorithms.
        When I practiced on LeetCode, I could tell I had significant gaps. I'm also an AI enthusiast who has followed
        the evolution of GPT from 3.5 all the way to 5.2, so I understood early on that large language models would
        eventually excel at competitive programming problems. After all, these problems have clear right and wrong
        answers, abundant high-quality training data, and open-source solutions—perfect conditions for AI to thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a while, this realization made me stop practicing. I assumed companies would move away from algorithmic
        interviews since AI could solve these problems so easily. Why invest hundreds of hours mastering something a
        machine could do better?
      </p>

      <h2>The Debugging Revelation</h2>
      <p>
        Then I started using AI coding tools extensively—what some call "vibe coding"—and everything changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        After wading through countless instances of AI-generated slop, I noticed a pattern: the programmers who got
        the most value from AI tools weren't the ones who blindly accepted whatever the model produced. They were
        skilled developers who knew exactly what instructions to give, could immediately spot flawed output, and
        understood whether code was production-ready or just superficially correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you lack strong fundamentals in programming and system design, you can't effectively evaluate AI-generated
        code. You don't know what questions to ask or what problems to look for. In this sense, DSA knowledge and
        competitive programming skills have become more valuable, not less—contrary to what many people assume today.
      </p>

      <h2>The Problem-Solving Imperative</h2>
      <p>
        There's a deeper issue at play. Using AI passively is similar to mindlessly scrolling through YouTube or
        Instagram: copying and pasting whatever the model gives you doesn't make you smarter. If anything, it
        atrophies your cognitive abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Competitive programming offered me something different—a way to actively improve my focus, concentration,
        and problem-solving skills. These are fundamentally human capabilities that become more precious as AI handles
        routine tasks. What better investment could I make in myself, regardless of where my career takes me?
      </p>

      <h2>A New Kind of Credential</h2>
      <p>
        This brings me to a broader point about higher education. Like many others, I've watched the traditional
        value proposition of college erode. A degree no longer guarantees employment or a clear place in society the
        way it once did.
      </p>
      <p>
        Increasingly, I see universities functioning less as credential factories and more as talent pools—places
        where companies and organizations scout for exceptional minds. This is already how top quantitative firms
        like Jane Street approach recruiting. But with rampant grade inflation, academic performance has become a
        noisy signal at best.
      </p>
      <p>
        Competitions like ICPC offer something different. They're conducted in person, which means you can't cheat.
        Strong performance provides legitimate, verifiable evidence of problem-solving ability and intelligence. In
        an era of inflated credentials and AI-assisted everything, that kind of authentic signal carries real weight.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        So while the AI wave pushes everyone in one direction—toward delegation, automation, and cognitive
        outsourcing—I've decided to swim against the current. Competitive programming isn't just about landing a
        job or winning competitions. It's about developing my inherent capabilities as a thinker and problem-solver.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an age of artificial intelligence, investing in genuine intelligence feels like the right bet.
