    <h1>A New Dawn for Software Engineering</h1>

    <article class="post-box">
      <p>
        Many people—including me—are worried about what the new AI wave could mean for the future of work. A big part
        of that fear is the possibility of jobs being replaced. For me, it shows up most clearly in software
        engineering: junior developer roles seem to be shrinking as AI tools increase the productivity of senior
        engineers and experienced developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        On one hand, this is a natural shift. Technology changes, expectations evolve, and if you can't adapt, you fall
        behind. On the other hand, companies will always want the best talent—whether in software engineering (which is
        being heavily impacted) or in other engineering fields that may be less affected for now. With more money
        flowing into AI, it's reasonable to think major players will invest not only in infrastructure, but also in top
        intellectual talent to gain an edge in an increasingly competitive race.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, companies and teams don't always operate in the most rational or productive ways. Sometimes
        management pushes hiring freezes or short-term cost cutting, and teams follow through—even if it harms
        long-term talent development. It's difficult to justify future returns, especially when it comes to hiring and
        training people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, I think the bigger picture is clear: software development is about to accelerate at an unprecedented
        scale and speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, we'll see plenty of "AI slop"—low-quality output that spreads quickly and affects many parts of life. But
        I don't think great engineers will let that become the standard. In the end, your name is on the work you ship,
        whether the code was written by you, generated by AI, or created through some combination of both. If you can't
        take responsibility for what goes into production, you probably won't be the kind of engineer who thrives in
        this AI era.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if you understand exactly what you want and can use AI intentionally—prompting, refining,
        verifying, and staying accountable—you can dramatically increase your productivity and impact. That kind of
        leverage won't just help individual careers; it should also raise the pace of innovation across the software
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we use these tools well (and responsibly), this boom in development speed—and ideally in code quality—could
        lead to better products, faster iteration, and more ambitious engineering across every domain. In my view, this
        acceleration could mark a new dawn: more productive environments, more creation, and more inventions that
        benefit humanity over the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
        So yes, I'm worried. But I'm also excited—because reduced development time might unlock scientific and
        technological breakthroughs we simply couldn't reach as quickly before.
