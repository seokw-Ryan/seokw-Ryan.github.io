    <h1>The Quant-ification of Software Engineering</h1>
    <div class="post-date">February 18, 2026</div>
    <article class="post-box">
      <p>
        There's been no shortage of discussion about the future of software engineering. I've told many of my friends
        that I believe the industry is shifting in a direction that closely resembles how quantitative finance firms
        hire for their research departments — and I think 2026 is the year that shift has become undeniable.
      </p>

      <h2>How Quant Hiring Works</h2>
      <p>
        In quantitative research — not systems, not hardware, not sales — the hiring philosophy has always been simple:
        find the absolute brightest minds and pay them accordingly. Quant firms don't need thousands of researchers.
        Every year, they cast a wide net and pull in a small number of exceptional people from the applicant pool.
        Those people get compensated handsomely precisely because they are the best of their cohort.
      </p>

      <h2>How Software Engineering Was Different</h2>
      <p>
        Software engineering hasn't operated this way for most of the 21st century. The demand for engineers grew so
        rapidly that companies optimized for volume. They needed more and more bodies — people with computer science
        degrees, bootcamp graduates, anyone who could write code — funneled into their organizations as fast as
        possible. Hiring was broad, and the bar, while not nonexistent, was far from exclusive.
      </p>

      <h2>The Convergence</h2>
      <p>
        That era is ending. In 2026, the pull toward quant-style hiring in software engineering is real. Now, I don't
        think it will ever become an exact mirror. Software engineering is far more general than quant research: you
        don't need quant researchers at every company, but you do want some form of SWE capability at nearly every
        company. The sheer breadth of the field means there will always be more roles and more variety than in
        quantitative finance.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the direction is clear. There will be fewer software engineering roles, and the best engineers will command
        disproportionately high compensation. We've already seen this dynamic play out with AI engineers and
        researchers, who have been poached with extraordinary packages over the past few years. I believe that trend
        will slowly but surely spread across the broader software engineering landscape.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Means</h2>
      <p>
        The competitive landscape — the red ocean — is only getting redder. The bar is rising, and the middle of the
        talent distribution will feel the squeeze most acutely.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here's the flip side: if you are genuinely passionate about this craft, if you are talented and willing to
        put in the hard work, you may find yourself in a stronger position than ever. When companies are hunting for
        the best rather than hiring in bulk, being exceptional is the clearest path forward.
