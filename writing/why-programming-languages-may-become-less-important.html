    <h1>Why Programming Languages May Become Less Important</h1>

    <article class="post-box">
      <p>
        AI is changing how we work, no matter who you are or what field you're in. Software engineering and
        programming are among the domains feeling that shift most directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, I see AI primarily as a tool. Maybe that changes in the future, but today it's something
        programmers use to move faster: generating code, explaining unfamiliar concepts, finding bugs, writing
        tests, and helping with documentation. The important part is that it accelerates development, and when
        development accelerates, the shape of the work changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally, we've had many programming languages because different languages serve different purposes. C
        and C++ have historically been foundational for embedded and systems-level development. They're fast, widely
        understood, and have huge ecosystems, but they're also notorious for security and memory-safety pitfalls.
        Meanwhile, languages like Java, JavaScript, SQL, Python, and Rust exist for good reasons too. Each has
        evolved around particular use cases, tradeoffs, and communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of that, I don't think it makes sense to say one language is "best" in general. In a lot of ways,
        languages are tools that evolved to match constraints in different environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as AI-driven development accelerates, I expect two things to happen:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. New languages (or major extensions of existing ones) will keep appearing, tailored to specific domains
        and industries.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. The importance of syntax will shrink, because AI will handle more of the translation between intent and
        implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, we may not stop using programming languages, but we may stop thinking in them as much.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see this as similar to what happened with assembly. We didn't exactly "delete" assembly from computing.
        It's still there, and it still matters in certain contexts. But for most developers, it became less central
        because higher-level abstractions took over. In the same way, I think today's mainstream programming
        languages could become increasingly "background infrastructure", still real, still important, but less
        visible in day-to-day work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, this doesn't mean expertise disappears. AI is not perfect. It makes mistakes, produces
        incomplete solutions, and can hallucinate details, just like humans can. There will still be a strong need
        for domain experts and language experts, especially in critical systems. If you're working on something like
        the Linux kernel, you want people who deeply understand C, operating systems, performance tradeoffs, and
        failure modes.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as AI improves at debugging, verification, code generation, and adaptation across languages, the
        center of gravity shifts. The most valuable skill becomes less about knowing the exact syntax of a language
        and more about system thinking: designing architectures, defining requirements, reasoning about constraints,
        evaluating tradeoffs, anticipating failures, ensuring security, and aligning technical decisions with
        real-world goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        My guess is that over time, we'll move from "language thinking" to "system thinking." Languages won't
        vanish, but they'll matter less than the ability to clearly specify what you want, validate what you got, and
        design systems that work reliably in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
        And honestly, I think that's pretty interesting.
