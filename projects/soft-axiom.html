        Soft Axiom is a full-stack AI knowledge management platform with
        RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) capabilities. Ingest
        documents, query them through a chat interface backed by language
        models, and manage your personal knowledge base. The Next.js
        frontend is deployed on Vercel and the FastAPI backend runs on
        AWS App Runner. Live at
        <a href="https://softaxiom.com" style="color: inherit;">softaxiom.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        There is no shortage of ChatGPT wrappers. The barrier to shipping
        an AI-powered product has dropped to the point where most of them
        are thin skins over an API call&mdash;prompt in, completion out,
        deploy to Vercel, done. The result is a flood of nearly identical
        apps that outsource every hard problem to a single provider and
        call it a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to go in the opposite direction: build a full-stack AI
        application end to end, from training and fine-tuning models with
        PyTorch and LoRA, to implementing the retrieval and embedding
        pipeline, to standing up the backend (FastAPI, PostgreSQL with
        pgvector), the frontend (Next.js), and the infrastructure
        (Docker, AWS App Runner) for actual cloud deployment. Not because
        wrapping an API is wrong, but because I wanted to understand every
        layer of the stack myself&mdash;how embeddings are generated and
        stored, how hybrid search and reranking work under the hood, how
        a model serving pipeline fits together, and what it actually takes
        to go from a training script to a running service. Soft Axiom is
        the vehicle for that.
      </p>

      <h2>Engineering and Product Lessons</h2>
      <p>
        Soft Axiom is also an exercise in using the best available
        engineering tools across the stack, including modern cloud
        computing. The project combines application development,
        infrastructure, model integration, and deployment workflows
        instead of treating them as separate concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest lesson has been that the quality of outcomes depends
        on the quality of the question. AI is most useful when the right
        issue is identified first, then broken down into testable
        hypotheses and fixed with fast feedback loops.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also forced explicit tradeoff analysis: understanding how
        Vercel and AWS differ, comparing price-to-performance by workload,
        deciding what belongs in an MVP, and choosing when a feature is
        ready for public release. Security and privacy are treated as core
        product constraints, not post-launch add-ons.
      </p>

      <h2>Document Ingestion and RAG</h2>
      <p>
        The ingestion pipeline loads documents from multiple formats,
        chunks them for retrieval, and stores the chunks with embeddings
        in PostgreSQL with pgvector. At query time, Soft Axiom retrieves
        relevant chunks, optionally re-ranks them, and sends only the
        current query plus the retrieved context to the configured LLM
        provider.
      </p>

      <h2>LLM Providers</h2>
      <p>
        Soft Axiom supports multiple LLM providers: Ollama for fully
        local inference, plus OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google for
        cloud-backed queries.
      </p>

      <h2>Deployment Stack</h2>
      <p>
        The frontend is a Next.js 14 app deployed on Vercel. It
        communicates with the backend through API route rewrites that
        proxy requests to the backend origin, keeping the browser
        pointed at a single domain. Authentication is handled by
        AWS Cognito using the OIDC authorization-code flow via
        oidc-client-ts and react-oidc-context on the client side.
      </p>
      <p>
        The backend is a FastAPI application running on AWS App Runner
        with the Python 3.11 runtime. App Runner performs source-based
        deployments from the main branch: the build phase installs
        dependencies from a pinned requirements file, downloads the
        AWS RDS SSL certificate bundle, and the run phase starts
        Uvicorn on port 8000. JWT tokens from Cognito are verified
        on every authenticated request using JWKS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data lives in a PostgreSQL instance on AWS RDS with the
        pgvector extension enabled. Document chunks and their 1536-
        dimensional embeddings (generated by OpenAI
        text-embedding-3-small) are stored together, and retrieval
        uses a hybrid of HNSW vector similarity search and
        full-text search with tsvector indexes. Connections go
        through asyncpg with a pool of 2&ndash;10 connections and
        SSL enforced via the RDS CA bundle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is closed source.</p>

      <h2>What's Next</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Finalize MVP boundaries and public launch milestones</li>
        <li>Expand security and privacy controls (data retention, access policies, and auditability)</li>
        <li>Continue Vercel/AWS price-performance profiling as usage scales</li>
